# TIC-TAC-TOE
First project at GA

This project will explore the design of the simple game TIC,TAC TOE.

The projects started on Tuesday and it will be delivered by Friday morning.

The proposed timeline consists in 4 macro-categories:

1)TUESDAY: Understanding and graphic visualisation of the project

2)WEDNESDAY: First draft of the JavaScript code and of the game's design and
             style in CSS

3)THURSDAY: Code testing, styling improvements and general review of the whole
            project. This phase will also be used to implement bonuses (if the
            game runs as required) or to debug and fix issues.

4)FRIDAY: Last review and presentation to the class                   


PROJECT DESCRIPTION and GOAL

Design and code the TIC TAC TOE game is the main goal of the project. In
particular, the game should present all the features involved in this popular game

PROJECT DELIVERABLES

The project followed the timeline proposed and it achieved the main tasks.

In order to show the project's development flow, a repo was created on github
and many commit were pushed into the origin master files.

The final result can be shown in this link:

 <https://brunorampi.github.io/TIC-TAC-TOE/>


The project has 4 files: index.html, style.css, tic_tat_toe.js and README.md

INDEX. html

This file presents is linked to the stylesheet, the JavaScript and a jQuery
Library. It created the grid for the game and other elements useful for playing

STYLE.css

It has few features to style the page. In particular it created a responsive
grid

tic_tac_toe.js

According to the level of difficulty, it used JavaScript codes or jQuery. It
declared variables and all the function to make the game playable. In particular,
when the game starts, the code is able to switch from one player to the other
and to check for every move who (and if) is the winner.
If there is a winner or the player draw, it asks to the players if the want to play
another time and so on.

COMMENTS and FUTURE RESEARCH/WORK
The project followed the timeline proposed and it achieved the main tasks but
it is important to say that the JS file required more effort that what was
expected. Thus, the next steps involve the development of the CSS file.
Moreover, the file is code is not sufficiently DRY but from the final user's
point of view, this doesn't reflect problems.
