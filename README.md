This project will explore the design of the simple game TIC,TAC TOE.

The projects started on Tuesday and it will be delivered by Friday morning.

The proposed timeline consists in 4 macro-categories:

             style in CSS

3)THURSDAY: Code testing, styling improvements and general review of the whole
            project. This phase will also be used to implement bonuses (if the
            game runs as required) or to debug and fix issues.

4)FRIDAY: Last review and presentation to the class
